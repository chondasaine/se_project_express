# 👗 WTWR: What To Wear

## 🌦️ Project Overview

WTWR (What To Wear) is a full-stack web application that helps users decide how to dress based on the current weather conditions. This repository focuses on the **backend configuration** of WTWR, powering features like user management, clothing item recommendations, and interaction endpoints (likes, deletions, and more).

Whether you're facing wind, snow, or blazing sunshine—WTWR equips you with the perfect wardrobe guidance.
